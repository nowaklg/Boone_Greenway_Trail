*Project Outline*

This lab for Web Mapping was focused on the creation of an interactive map of a trail route. This map was created using Leaflet base maps from a remote server. I chose a basemap that was lightly colored and included topographic lines. These features seemed important to have on my map, since the trail route I chose has some variation in elevation. The mapped region on my web map is the Boone Greenway that runs through Clawson-Burnely Park.

This map was created using data from Leaflet as well as All Trails, which was downloaded as a .gpx file to show the route of the Boone Greenway. This .gpx file was then put into the geojson.io website to edit the route further. There I coded a few points on the trail to mark and label key features. The features I labeled included:

* Clawson-Burnley Park Entrance
* Weaver Ridge
* Clark Curve
* Kennedy Trail
* Covered Bridge
* Historic Dam Site

The GeoJSON was then downloaded from <a href="http://geojson.io/#map=2/0/20">geojson.io</a> and uploaded to VisualStudio. This data was then connected to the webpage on the index tab and edits were made to create a red dashed line of the trail.
